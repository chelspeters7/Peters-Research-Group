abstract: "Surface water salinity is a critical factor in the health of
  estuarine systems and coastal water resources. It is widely accepted that
  groundwater withdrawals can lead to reductions in baseflow (i.e., the
  groundwater contribution to streamflow). In coastal estuaries, streamflow
  depletion is associated with increases in estuarine water salinity. The
  dynamics of this saltwater-freshwater balance have been studied, as have the
  relationships between groundwater pumping and streamflow, but a link between
  these processes in coastal watersheds is yet to be studied. In this project,
  we assess the potential implications of groundwater pumping on estuarine water
  quality in two Southeastern coastal rivers: Savannah River, GA and Suwanee
  River, Florida. We use statistical evaluations of streamflow and salinity
  records to explore groundwater-withdrawal effects. We consider the potential
  for future pumping impacts using an analytical model to predict the extent of
  tidally-influenced saltwater intrusion in the rivers under different
  scenarios. The two watersheds highlight differences between the time scales of
  two processes that control stream salinity: (1) short-term changes in the
  meteorological regime (e.g., tides, storms), and (2) long-term trends in
  groundwater levels and subsequent salinization due to baseflow reduction. The
  predictive model demonstrates reason for water resource concern with increased
  groundwater use.   "
