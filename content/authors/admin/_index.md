Dr. Chelsea Peters joined Environmental Studies at Roanoke College in 2020. As a hydrologist, Dr. Petersâ€™ interests broadly revolve around water resources, human adaptation, and climate change. She received her Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, and has since been researching and teaching at the University of Delaware. She uses a variety of field techniques, modeling approaches, and quantitative and qualitative datasets to address the challenges of sustainable water management. Previously, her work was based in Bangladesh where she worked to unravel the dynamic water system of the climatevulnerable coastal region. More recently, her research aims to characterize the salinization of coastal water resources in the Mid-Atlantic using hydrogeologic modeling, economic experiments, and stakeholder decision-making. Peters is a certified Project Management Professional and an active volunteer for international water development projects. Her work always incorporates aspects of knowledge transfer, partner engagement, and science communication.
