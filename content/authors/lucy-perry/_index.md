Lucy graduated in 2021 with a major in Environmental Studies. Lucy was a member of the women’s soccer team here and a huge fan of the English Premier League club Liverpool. She loves to be outside, specifically being outside pushing some physical limits. Some of these activities include trail running, backpacking, and whitewater paddle boarding. Right after graduation, Lucy is starting her journey hiking the Appalachian Trail, from Georgia to Maine. Then she plans to move out West and start her next journey of figuring out what Environmental Science related career she wants to follow—while continuing to go on new and compelling adventures!
