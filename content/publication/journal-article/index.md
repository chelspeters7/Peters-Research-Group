abstract: "In the polder region of coastal Bangladesh, shallow groundwater is
  primarily brackish with unpredictable occurrence of freshwater pockets. Delta
  building processes, including the codeposition of fresh‐to‐saline porewater
  and sediments, have formed the shallow aquifer. Impermeable clay facies and
  the lack of a topographical gradient limit the flow of groundwater and its
  mixing with surface water so controls on spatial variability of salinity are
  not obvious. By characterizing groundwater‐surface water (GW‐SW) interactions,
  this study attempted to identify areas of potable groundwater for the polder
  communities. We used transects of piezometers, cores, electromagnetic
  induction, and water chemistry surveys to explore two sources of potential
  fresh groundwater: (1) tidal channel‐aquifer exchange and (2) meteoric
  recharge. Fresh groundwater proved difficult to find due to heterogeneous
  subsurface lithology, asymmetrical tidal dynamics, extreme seasonal
  fluctuations in rainfall, and limited field data. Geophysical observations
  suggest substantial lateral variability in shallow subsurface conductivity
  profiles. Piezometers show varying degrees of tidal pressure attenuation away
  from the channels. Nevertheless, the active exchange of freshwater appears to
  be limited due to low permeability of banks and surface sediments. Results
  indicate that pockets of fresh groundwater cannot be identified using readily
  available hydrogeological methods, so alternative drinking water sources
  should be pursued. By better understanding the hydrogeology of the system,
  however, communities will be better equipped to redirect water management
  resources to more feasible and sustainable drinking water options."
