abstract: The uncertainty in methane (CH4) source strength of rice fields and
  wetlands is particularly high in South Asia CH4 budgets. We used satellite
  observations of CH4 column mixing ratios from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder
  (AIRS), Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography
  (SCIAMACHY), and Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) to estimate the
  contribution of Bangladesh emissions to atmospheric CH4 concentrations. Using
  satellite‐derived inundation area as a proxy for source area, we developed a
  simple inverse advection model that estimates average annual CH4 surface
  fluxes to be 4, 9, and 19 mg CH4 m−2 h−1 in AIRS, SCIAMACHY, and GOSAT,
  respectively. Despite this variability, our flux estimates varied over a
  significantly narrower range than reported values for CH4 surface fluxes from
  a survey of 32 studies reporting ground‐based observations between 0 and 260
  mg CH4 m−2 h−1. Upscaling our satellite‐derived surface flux estimates, we
  estimated total annual CH4 emissions for Bangladesh to be 1.3 ± 3.2, 1.8 ±
  2.0, 3.1 ± 1.6 Tg yr−1, depending on the satellite. Our estimates of total
  emissions are in line with the median of total emission values for Bangladesh
  reported in earlier studies.
