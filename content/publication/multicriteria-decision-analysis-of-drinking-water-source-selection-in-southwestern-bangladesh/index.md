abstract: Decision analysis methods provide opportunities to explore
  alternatives for drinking water resources in impoverished, rural regions of
  developing countries. With varying success, southwestern Bangladesh
  communities currently use multiple drinking water sources, including rainwater
  harvesting, ponds, pond sand filters, managed aquifer recharge (MAR), and
  tubewells. This study uses a variety of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA)
  methods to assess the probable success of these drinking water sources based
  on various technical, economic, social, and environmental factors. Data
  include an assortment of physical and social sources including focus group
  interviews, surveys, and water quality measurements. Additionally, the MCDA
  methods (multiple attribute value theory, analytic hierarchy process, ELECTRE
  I, and ELECTRE III) are informed by preferences from three
  stakeholders—locals, nongovernmental organizations, and environmental science
  academics—to ensure proper weighting of criteria for success. Across all MCDA
  methods, we find that rainwater harvesting is the most likely to succeed as a
  reliable drinking water source in the region. Conversely, MAR is the least
  preferred alternative. Sensitivity analyses suggest a robust ranking order
  that is relatively insensitive to model parameters, including water source
  performance score and stakeholder weighting, across all criteria categories.
  This case study demonstrates how decision modeling and alternative assessment
  can be the first step to reach sustainable solutions in complex water
  management problems.
